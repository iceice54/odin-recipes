    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Gather the family round with this quick and easy shepherd's pie recipe. The meat mixture can be made ahead and frozen.</p>
    <p>You can also substitute instant potatoes for the real thing if you're in a hurry. I especially love to use white cheddar in this recipe!</p>
